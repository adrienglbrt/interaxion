introduction: >
  As Maison Boucheron marks its 160th anniversary, we created 8 animated film
  delving into the storied history of the maison. We asked 8 talents to work on
  a chapter of the Maison with his own style. Jean-Pacôme Dedieux proposed a
  animated film of the iconic watch 'Reflet'


  Created in 1947, Reflet is Maison Boucheron’s iconic timepiece, a
  concentration of elegance and innovation. Reflet truly shines with its gadroon
  motif and discreetly sparkling cabochon, but especially its ingenious clasp
  and its interchangeable straps.
