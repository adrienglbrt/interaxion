introduction: >
  We were asked to create an animated preview for the launch of the Open Spaces
  Magazine.


  It's a print magazine focused on the intersection of art, travel, and the
  outdoors. The open path to experience that takes you to a destination; the
  state of transit, the perpetual movement of art and emotion into space.
